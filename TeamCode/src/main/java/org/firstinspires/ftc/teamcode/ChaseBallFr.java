 * ============================================================================
 *  LIMELIGHT BALL CHASE AUTONOMOUS
 * ============================================================================
 *
 *  WHAT THIS PROGRAM DOES
 *  ----------------------
 *  1. SEARCH  - Spin the robot in place until the Limelight sees a yellow ball.
 *  2. CENTER  - Turn until that ball is lined up with the middle of the camera.
 *  3. CHASE   - Turn on the intake and drive forward at the ball, making small
 *               steering corrections, until the ball disappears under the camera.
 *  4. SWEEP   - Keep driving forward a moment longer so the intake grabs it.
 *  5. PAUSE   - Wait 3 seconds.
 *  6. Go back to step 1 and do it all again for the next ball.
 *
 *  WHY IT IS WRITTEN THIS WAY
 *  --------------------------
 *  This is a LinearOpMode, which means the code runs top-to-bottom like a
 *  recipe. That is much easier to read than a state machine when the robot only
 *  ever does one thing at a time. Everything lives in this one file on purpose -
 *  no helper classes, no odometry, no Pedro Pathing. Chasing a ball only needs
 *  the camera and the four drive motors.
 *
 *  BEFORE THIS WILL WORK: SET UP THE LIMELIGHT PIPELINE
 *  ----------------------------------------------------
 *  The Limelight does the image processing, not the robot. You have to teach it
 *  what "yellow ball" looks like ONE TIME using its web interface:
 *
 *    1. Power the robot on. Connect a laptop to the robot's WiFi.
 *    2. In a browser go to  http://limelight.local:5801   (or use the
 *       Limelight's IP address, often 172.29.0.1:5801 over USB).
 *    3. In the pipeline dropdown at the top, pick pipeline 1. Leave pipeline 0
 *       alone - that is the AprilTag pipeline the rest of our code uses.
 *    4. Set the pipeline TYPE to "Color / Retroreflective".
 *    5. Point the camera at a yellow ball on the field. On the "Input" tab turn
 *       the exposure DOWN until the picture looks dark and the ball still glows.
 *       Low exposure is the single biggest trick for reliable color tracking -
 *       it makes the ball stand out and it makes the code immune to gym lights.
 *    6. On the "Thresholding" tab, drag the Hue / Saturation / Value sliders
 *       until ONLY the ball shows up white in the threshold view and everything
 *       else is black. Yellow usually lands near Hue 20-35, with high
 *       Saturation (150-255) and high Value (100-255).
 *    7. On the "Contour Filtering" tab set the area filter so tiny specks of
 *       noise are ignored. Something like 0.05% minimum area is a good start.
 *       You can also set the target area / aspect ratio to prefer round shapes.
 *    8. Walk around the field with a ball and confirm the crosshair sticks to it
 *       and nothing else lights up. Tune until that is true. GARBAGE IN,
 *       GARBAGE OUT - if the pipeline is sloppy the robot will chase a shadow.
 *    9. Make sure the pipeline is SAVED to slot 1 before you unplug.
 *
 *  UNDERSTANDING tx AND ty
 *  -----------------------
 *  The Limelight reports where a target is as two ANGLES, not as X/Y position:
 *     tx = how many degrees LEFT (-) or RIGHT (+) of center the target is.
 *     ty = how many degrees BELOW (-) or ABOVE (+) center the target is.
 *
 *  Our camera is tilted DOWN about 30 degrees, so a ball sitting on the floor
 *  close to the robot appears LOW in the picture (a very negative ty), and a
 *  ball far away appears HIGH in the picture (a ty closer to zero or positive).
 *  That gives us a free way to find the CLOSEST ball: it is the one with the
 *  SMALLEST (most negative) ty.
 *
 *  HOW TO TUNE THIS PROGRAM
 *  ------------------------
 *  Every number you might want to change is a constant at the top of the class.
 *  Change those, not the code below them.
